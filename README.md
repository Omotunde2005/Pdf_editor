<h1>PDFly: A PDF editor built with flask</h1>


<h3>About</h3>

<p><b>PDFly</b> is a PDF editor that enables you to manipulate/edit a PDF file.
For now, this web based editor is capable of <i><b>resizing</b></i> and <i><b>encrypting</b></i> a PDF file. It does not accept pdf files larger than 16MB</p>

<h3>Project State</h3>

<p>PDFly is still in production mode. Deployment will take place after making a few modifications to the front end.
After deployment, the project will be made open source</p>


<h3>Additional features to expect</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Extracting images from a PDF
</li>
<li>
Converting a PDF file to .docx, .txt, etc
</li>
<li>
Adding new Pages to a PDF document
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Limitations</h3>
Because the project is still in development mode, edited/processed PDF documents are stored in the server, which is not a good practise.
A better solution will be implemented before project deployment.


<h3>Contribution</h3>
<p>If you'll like to contribute to the project before deployment, kindly contact me via my Twitter account in the bio section, so we can work together. 
My aim is to create an open source file editor with so many file editing capabilities available for free to all.</p>
